# tidal_breathing_segmentation
Algorithm to detect inspiration and expiration in a respiratory signal based on: 

1. ["Tidal breath analysis for infant pulmonary function testing" J.H.T. Bates](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/16/6/1180.short)
2. ["Comparative Investigations of Algorithms for the Detection of Breaths in Newborns with Disturbed Respiratory Signals" M. Schmidt, B](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbmr.1998.1493)

Repo includes :

- cyclesAdvance.m : main function 
- estimateRespFreq.m & getT.m: sub functions
- test.mat :file with data to test the main function 
- test.mlx : file with an example running main fuction with data in test.mat
